This repository contains the source code for the paper " Truncated D-vine Copula Knockoffs for continuous and
ordinal predictors"

The computational implementations of the proposed methods were carried out using R, employing versions 3.6.3.

The code for running the simulations and the application to a real dataset uses several packages from R. The packages are the following:

ggplot2_3.3.5          survival_3.4-0         dplyr_1.0.9            doParallel_1.0.17     
iterators_1.0.14       knockoff_0.3.5         foreach_1.5.2          glmnet_4.1-4          
Matrix_1.5-3           TSP_1.2-4              VineCopula_2.4.5       rvinecopulib_0.6.2.1.3
